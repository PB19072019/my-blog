        Hello, my name is Donrawee Waeyeng. I have a background in public health, with a focus on environmental and occupational health. I’ve worked as a lecturer and researcher for several years, mainly involved in research related to lead exposure, road safety, and health risk assessment in communities. 🧪🚸🌱

        Recently, I’ve transitioned to independent research work while continuing to collaborate with public health organizations. I enjoy developing practical solutions that can be applied in real-world settings, especially in areas related to community safety and environmental health. 🏘️

        I’m currently based in Phuket and balancing research with other responsibilities. Lately, I’ve also been spending time learning new things—both professionally and personally. That includes exploring new topics in tech and public communication, as well as trying my hand at cooking and baking. 🧁🍳
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m always open to learning, collaboration, and new ideas—especially when they can lead to meaningful outcomes. 🤝✨
